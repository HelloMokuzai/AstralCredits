    <p>Burn however much sgbXAC you want to bridge by sending it to <code id="burn-address"></code>, receiving a 10:1 ratio of flareXAC in return.</p>
    <p>If you weren't able to submit the TX hash the first time for whatever reason, you can manually enter it and try again.</p>

    <h1>Step 2: Submit TX Hash</h1>
