**Astral Credits is a fun, community-driven, open-source peer-to-peer digital currency project developing decentralized applications on the FLARE & SONGBIRD Networks, built upon sound money principles.**

*Our vision is to bootstrap a completely self-sustaining ecosystem through the free & fair distribution of XAC tokens to the FLARE NETWORKS community. Astral Credits boasts a fixed supply cap, sound monetary policy and a free & fair distribution model to promote strong Store of Value (SoV) like properties.*

- **Free & fair distribution model** - 80% of tokens to be distributed freely. 10% reserved for NFT badge airdrops and the remaining 10% in reserve to fund future projects to expand the XAC ecosystem.
